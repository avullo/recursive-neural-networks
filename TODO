-- StructuredInstance

- constructor from input stream, adapt to different domains by initialising different skeletons

-- StructuredDomain

- Skeleton is built by StructuredInstance during its initialisation

-- Node

- flexible number of state transition networks requires storing a dynamic set of layer activations

- must be able to deal with a generic form of node output/target

-- DataSet

- read configuration parameter to trigger building structured instances differently according to the domain

- methods to read from input streams depending on the domain

-- DPAG

- stores just useful declarations for dealing with vertex and edge traversals, leave graph comparison functions
to more specialised applications, e.g. search in the space of graphs with an oracle

-- Recursive NNs

- a single, non templatised, implementation able to build and compute with a dynamic set of state transition functions
  according to the domain

- hidden/output activation functions have their own polymorphic hierarchy with the error minimisation procedure too

- must be able to deal with a generic form of super-source output/target
